# ABSTRACT
As cancer research continues to evolve, the business units and researchers involved in this pursuit will need to be able to quickly and easily be able to display their findings to laymen both in internal meetings, but also to the public.  This critical piece is best handled through visualizations.  While most cancer research data has now been ported into Electronic Data Capture (EDC) systems.  These systems generally have no way of visualizing the data to all the business units that are involved in industry research.  Most of these systems require data to be exported to other systems in order to create visualization of the data.  The Matplotlib package that is available via Python programming is a powerful tool that can create basic visualization of large data sets.

# 1. INTRODUCTION
Cancer research is an ever evolving field that its utilizing data science technology to help to make research more easily communicated to those outside of the research and data perspective.  Visualization is a powerful tool for researchers, company executives, and the general public.  Matplotlib is a open source library within the Python environment.  This environment provides simple but extremely powerful 2D and 3D visualizations of large amounts of data.  The types of visualizations available within this library range from plots to scatterplots with very little code required.  This could become a very simple to teach, but powerful tool within the research community.  This would be especially helpful for scientists to be able to display their data to those that are not well versed in data.

# 3. MATPLOTLIB FEATURES
Matplotlib is a massive library that allows for very easy creation of basic plots, while also providing the functionality to create very intricate and powerful visualizations depending on your skill with the library.  The most utilized package within the library is pyplot.  
# 4. MATPLOTLIB USE CASE FOR CLINICAL TRIALS VISUALIZATIONS
Oncology clinical trial research and clinical trial research in general generates an enormous amount of data.  Clinical trials can include thousands of patients with health data for multiple years at a time.  Managing this massive amount of data is not a small task.  Thousands of individuals are involved in the procurement, entry, cleaning, and manipulation of these databases before a clinical trial can be called a success or failure.  The cost to bring a drug to market is currently estimated to be about 2.6 million dollars.  Along with this, it is estimated that the cost to run one clinical trial depending on its phase could be anywhere between 10 million to 40 million dollars.   

Most of the current electronic data capture systems are built in SQL relational databases and these databases do not provide great tracking or visualization tools for people of all backgrounds to be able to understand how the progress of research is going.  Most of the people involved in clinical trials research are not well versed in data manipulation, statistical analysis, or even have scientific mindset.  Accessibility of visualization tools are extremely important within large industry pharmaceutical companies for business units to be able to communicate with each other during the clinical trial process.
