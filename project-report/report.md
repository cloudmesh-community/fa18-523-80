## Abstract

Oncology research is an ever expanding field. In the past cancer treatment and research has been mainly focused on a casting a wide net by attempting to treat all individuals with a generalized treatment regiment. The focus of most of the large pharmaceutical companies that are involved in the creation and research of the main cancer fighting drugs has been on a one drug fits all methodology. In recent years this mindset has been beginning to change. Many of the large pharmaceutical companies are moving to a more tailored approach in combating cancer. This involves utilizing data analysis in tailoring treatments and analysis of data to predict outcomes of future trials. To further explore this idea the present study explores fine needle aspirate data from breast cancer research performed at University of Wisconsin. This study will utilize machine learning techniques to analyze and create visual representations of this data set.

## Introduction

Cancer is one of the most devestating conditions financially, emotionally, and physically to the person who is diagnosed and those around them. Breast cancer has high visability in the public eye and has some of the highest funding of any other types of cancer out there. Several large pharmaceutical companies and researchers get large grants to research new compounds and molecules to fight of these diseases. The oncology pharmaceutical is over a trillion dollar industry and each year their are thousands of clinical trials that are ongoing. 

## Requirements

## Dataset

The dataset utilized for this analysis is a collection of fine needle aspirate breast cancer tumor. This dataset includes 569 unique patients with 32 attributes per patient. The attributes provided by this dataset includes de-identified patient identifiers, pathological diagnosis, and tumor characteristics. The dataset is publicly available for analysis.

## Python Architecture

To perform our analysis and visualization we will utilize a Python 3 environment. On top of this we will be utilizing numpy, pandas, and matplotlib to load our dataset, perform analysis, and create visual representations of the data. 
This dataset provides us with a large amount of data on different characteristics of each tumor. This dataset also provides us with a diagnosis of the individual with breast cancer. By using both the characteristics of the analyzed tumor along with the patients diagnosis we might be able to look for tumor characteristics that are be indicative of a cancer diagnosis. This would be able to inform future clinical trial research in how to identify patients with metastatic versus benign tumor diagnosis. This could also allow for specialized treatment of specific type of breast cancer lesions. Depending on tumor density, radius, etc. might indicate that cancer was more likely to metastisize more quickly.
